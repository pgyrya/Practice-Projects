## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

In this project I have practiced applying reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. 
This project involves modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, 
and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library installed

### Code

The final code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. 
Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`.
Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
