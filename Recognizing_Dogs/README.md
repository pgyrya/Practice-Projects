# Introduction
This is my work fulfilling practice project built by Udacity team, designed to practice deep learning algorithm for computer vision with elements of Transfer learning, re-using popular network architectures (e.g. Xception).

Please refer to `dog_app.ipynb` for Jupyter notebook with analysis.
for HTML version, see report.html - you may need to download it on your computer to view as it's slightly over 5 MB.

Full credit goes to Udacity nanodegree program for designing most of the code base, I take credit for getting familiar with the setup and practicing developing the project to logical point envisioned by Udacity project.
